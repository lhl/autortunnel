This is a simple script for setting up an automatic reverse tunnel for
OS X machines using autossh. This is particularly useful for m2m
communication for NATd client machines.

Just run 'autortunnel' which is an interactive script to generate the
proper configs.

For Linux machines, check out:

TODO
---
* Finish ssh (non-autossh) path
